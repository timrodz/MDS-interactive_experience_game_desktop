Anxiety

Real Character – Anxiety sufferer

“You might say that I don’t look anxious, but anxiety doesn’t necessarily have a ‘look.’ I don’t have to be trembling or hyperventilating to be anxious.” 

“When I’m being quiet, I’m not sad, bored, tired or whatever else they want to fill in the blank with. There’s just so much going on in my mind, sometimes I can’t keep up with what’s going on around me.” 

“Sometimes I just need to be alone. It’s not personal. I’m not mad. I don’t have some problem. I don’t just need to shake it off and do something fun. I just need to be alone so I can reset myself and breathe a little.” 

 “Sometimes when I’m feeling the anxiety, I have no idea why I’m anxious.” 

“I never know when it’s going to hit me. And when it does, I just need you to support me. I can’t just turn it off.”

“Just remember, I’m still me. I’m not my anxiety.”

Sims Character

“You may have noticed from my unusual behaviour that I look anxious.”

“However, I am actually ‘neurotic’. This means I suffer from a range of anxiety related disorders, chosen at random. I know the term ‘neurotic’ is outdated and a primitive way to describe a mental illness, but that’s just the way I was created.” 

“I often feel anxious about things, especially mundane tasks around the house. But that’s alright - as soon as I get around to doing that task, I’m instantly calm again.”

“I can’t quite get a grip on life and will often ‘freak out’ at the click of a button. This can distress those around me, but immediately afterwards I will be fine.”

“I also can’t get sad or angry, I just feel anxious instead.”

Schizophrenia

Real Character - Schizophrenia sufferer

"I suffer from schizophrenia which involves being out of touch with reality,"

“I have an inability to discern what is real and not real, to think clearly, have normal emotional responses, and act normally in social situations.”

“You may think I’m a violent person, based on the common misconception that people who suffer from schizophrenia are extremely violent. In fact, people that suffer from schizophrenia are less violent and are much more likely to be victims than the aggressors.”

“The symptoms include an inability to experience pleasure, diminished emotional range and lack of motivation.  However, violence is not a symptom of schizophrenia.”

“I am not violent toward others. Instead I’m quite withdrawn and often prefer to be left alone.” 

“It is quite common for me to experience hallucinations, though they are mostly auditory. I do have the occasional visual hallucination, but not very often.”

“Although there is no cure for schizophrenia, the symptoms are highly treatable using a combination of medication and therapy.”

Joker

“I am often described as a psychotic homicidal maniac. My violence is often blamed on my schizophrenia that can put me out of touch with reality.”

“Normally someone who is ‘psychotic’ is experiencing symptoms of psychosis, a mental disorder, which can include auditory hallucinations, such as hearing voices; visual hallucinations, where they see objects that are not truly there.”

“But I don’t hear voices, I don’t have trouble telling what’s real from what isn’t, I don’t feel that the people I’m hurting somehow deserve it, I just think it's funny!”

“I may commit crimes for reasons that don’t make sense to you, but I know full well that the things I’m doing are real, and are seen as ‘wrong’ by society.”

“I have plenty of motivation and get a lot of enjoyment from concocting complicated schemes to wreak havoc on society.”

Insanity

Real Character - Doctor

“One common misconception the public has about serial murder and other serious crimes is that mental illness must play a major role. This is because the public generally assumes that in order for someone to commit these acts, they have to be ‘crazy’ or ‘insane.’”

“Indeed it is not normal for humans to be extremely violent and commit serious crimes. That doesn’t mean that mental disorders necessarily cause or contribute significantly to this kind of behaviour.”

“Insanity is actually not a psychiatric or mental health term, but instead a legal concept.”

“Video game villains are frequently referred to as ‘insane’. There is a common misunderstanding to the portrayal of insanity and what it means to be legally insane.”

“In the real world, only 1 percent of criminal cases plead not guilty by reason of insanity, and only 20 percent of those 1 percent are successful.”

Vaas

“Do you recognise me? I bet you do, even if I am a far cry away from home.”

“Want to know the definition of insanity? I can explain it to you.”

“Insanity is doing the exact same thing, over and over again, expecting things to change. That is crazy; but the first time somebody told me that...I don't know. I thought they were tricking me, so boom — I shot him.”

"The thing is, he was right. And then I started seeing: everywhere I looked, everywhere I looked, all these people, everywhere I looked, doing the exact same thing... over and over and over and over again thinking this time, it's gonna be different.”
